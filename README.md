## Description


This tool takes MRI datasets in the file formats (_.dcm_, _.nii_, _.nii.gz_ or _.mha_) as the input. 
Two Python scripts (_QC.py_ and _QCF.py_) are used to generate several tags and noise/information measurements for quality assessment. These scripts save the calculated measures in a  _.tsv_ file as well as generate _.png_ thumbnails for all images in a subject volume. These are then fed to the bunch of _.js_ scripts to create the user interface (_index.html_) output. The schematic framework of the tool is as follows.

## Running

To test that the code is working fine please try
```
D:\Downloads\MRQy-master>python QC.py --help

```
The output should be 
```
usage: QC.py [-h] output_folder_name [inputdir [inputdir ...]]

positional arguments:
  output_folder_name  the name of a subfolder on the Data directory of the
                      UserInterface folder.
  inputdir            input foldername consists of *.mha (*.nii or *.dcm)
                      files. For example:
                      'E:\Data\Rectal\RectalCancer_Multisite\UH'

optional arguments:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  
```
Standard usage is to run ``` QC.py –o output_folder_name “input directory” ``` i.e. 

```
python QC.py -o output_folder_name "E:\Data\Rectal\RectalCancer_Multisite\input_data_folder"

```
There is no need to make a subfolder in the Data directory, just specify its name in the command like above code line.
Every action will be print in the output console. The thumbnail images in the format of _.png_ will be saved on "...\UserInterface\Data\output_folder_name" with its original filename as its subfolder's name. Afterward, double click "index.html" (on e.g. "D:\Downloads\MRQy-master\UserInterface") to open front end user interface, select the respective _results.tsv_ file from the e.g. "D:\Downloads\MRQy-master\UserInterface\Data\output_folder_name" directory.
