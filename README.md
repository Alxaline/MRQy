## Description


This tool takes MRI datasets in the file formats (_.dcm_, _.nii_, _.nii.gz_ or _.mha_) as the input. \
Two Python scripts (_QC.py_ and _QCF.py_) are used to generate several tags and noise/information measurements for quality assessment. These scripts save the calculated measures in a  _.tsv_ file as well as generate _.png_ thumbnails for all images in a subject volume. These are then fed to the bunch of _.js_ scripts to create the user interface (_index.html_) output. The schematic framework of the tool is as follows.

## Prerequisites

The current version of the tool has been tested on the Python vresion 3.7.4. The required Python packages are listed in the following figure.

## Running

To test that the code is working fine please try
```
D:\Downloads\MRQy-master>python QC.py --help

```
The output should be 
```
usage: QC.py [-h] output_folder_name [inputdir [inputdir ...]]

positional arguments:
  output_folder_name  the subfolder name on the
                      '...\UserInterface\Data\output_folder_name' directory.
  inputdir            input foldername consists of *.mha (*.nii or *.dcm)
                      files. For example: 'E:\Data\Rectal\input_data_folder'

optional arguments:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  
```
Standard usage is to run ``` QC.py output_folder_name “input directory” ``` i.e. 

```
python QC.py output_folder_name "E:\Data\Rectal\RectalCancer_Multisite\input_data_folder"

```
There is no need to make a subfolder in the Data directory, just specify its name in the command like above code line.\
Every action will be printed in the output console. \
The thumbnail images in the format of _.png_ will be saved on "...\UserInterface\Data\output_folder_name" with its original filename as its subfolder's name. Afterward, double click "index.html" (on e.g. "D:\Downloads\MRQy-master\UserInterface") to open front end user interface, select the respective _results.tsv_ file from the e.g. "D:\Downloads\MRQy-master\UserInterface\Data\output_folder_name" directory.
