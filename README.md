# MRQy

MRQy tool is a new quality assessment and evaluation tool for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data.

## Description


This tool takes MRI datasets in the file formats (_.dcm_, _.nii_, _.nii.gz_ or _.mha_) as the input. Two Python scripts (_QC.py_ and _QCF.py_) are used to generate several tag and noise/information measurements for quality assessment. These scripts save the calculated measures in a  _.tsv_ file as well generate _.png_ thumbnails for all images in a subject volume. These are then fed to the bunch of _.js_ scripts to create the user interface (_index.html_) output. The schematic framework of the tool is as follows:

## Prerequisites

The current version of the tool has been tested on the Python vresion 3.7.4. The required Python packages are listed in the following

### General packages:

1. os, 2. argparse, 3. numpy, 4. datetime, 5. time, 6. matplotlib, 7. scipy, 8. itertools, 9. pandas, 10. warnings, and 11. skimage

### Specific packages:

Based on your input files format you may have to install one or more of the following packages: 
1. medpy (for _.mha_, _.nii_, and _.nii.gz_ files) and 2. pydicom (for _.dcm_ files)

2. The t-SNE and UMAP plots work with the sklearn and umap (umap-learn) packeges respectively. 


## Running

To test that the code is working fine please try
```
E:\Python_Codes\Github>python QC.py --help

```
The output should be 
```
usage: QC.py [-h] [-o OUTDIR] [inputdir [inputdir ...]]

positional arguments:
  inputdir              input foldername consists of *.mha files. For example:
                        'E:\Data\Rectal\RectalCancer_Multisite\UH'

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTDIR, --outdir OUTDIR
                        a subfolder on the Data directory of the UserInterface
                        i.e. E:\Python_Codes\Github\UserInterface\Data\Output
```
Standard usage is to run ``` QC.py –o output directory “input directory” ``` i.e. 

```
python QC.py -o E:\Python_Codes\Github\UserInterface\Data\Output "E:\Data\Rectal\RectalCancer_Multisite\UH"

```
There is no need to make a subfolder in the Data directory, just specify its name in the command like above code line.
Every action will be print in the output console. The thumbnail images in the format of _.png_ will be saved on E:\Python_Codes\Github\UserInterface\Data with its original filename as its subfolder's name. Afterward, double click index.html (on e.g. E:\Python_Codes\Github\UserInterface) to open front end user interface, select the respective results.tsv file from the E:\Python_Codes\Github\UserInterface\Data\Output directory.
